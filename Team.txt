History
The Kentucky Colonels were a member of the American Basketball 
Association for all of the league's nine years. The name is derived 
from the historic Kentucky colonels. The Colonels won the most games
and had the highest winning percentage of any franchise in the league's
history, but the team did not join the NBA in the 1976 ABA–NBA merger.
The downtown Louisville Convention Center (now known as The Gardens)
was the Colonels' original venue for the first three seasons before
 moving to Freedom Hall for the remaining seasons, beginning with 
the 1970–71 schedule.
